# Periodic-Table-Database
Submission for the freeCodeCamp Relational Database project.

A bash script that accepts a query as the parameter and queries a PostgreSQL database with info on periodic table elements for a matching element (based on atomic_number, element symbol or name). If a match is found, it outputs a message containing an amalgation of info on the element drawn from the databases.
