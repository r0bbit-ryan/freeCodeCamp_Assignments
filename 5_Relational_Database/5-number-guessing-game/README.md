# Number-Guessing-Game
Submission for the freeCodeCamp Relational Database project.

A bash script that generates a random secret number between 1 to 1000, prompts the user for guesses and tells the user if their guess was larger than or smaller than the secret number. The script ends when the user correctly guesses the number. 

User data (username, number of games played, and best game) are stored in a PostgreSQL table and drawn upon in the script to customize welcome messages.
